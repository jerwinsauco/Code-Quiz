This application was created for Week 4 Code Quiz Challenge mock-up provided. The intent of writing this code is to apply the author's knowledge and application to principles using Javascript and JSON. The functions of the project reflects soley to the requirment for this bootcamp challenge.  

The project is a great tool for any user or stakeholders that requires one to take set bank of questions with timer.

Once clicked, user will then presented with the set of questions. It is important to note that the timer starts as soon as the user clicked the "start" button.
